# recursion
here you will the following recursion operations :
 - display even numbers on the right.
 - display even numers on the left.
 - binary to decimal operation.
 - decimal to biary operation.
 - greatest common divisor between 2 integers.
 - lowest common multiple between 2 integers.

we did those during the lab session in uni ,and i felt the need to share them for the small chance that they would benefit someone like me ;)
